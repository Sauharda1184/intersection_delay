Intersection Delay Study Formulas:

Total Delay = Total Number Stopped ( not unique ) * 15 

Avg Delay per Stopped Vehicle = Total Delay * Number Stopped ( Unique )

Avg Delay per Approach Vehicle = Total Delay divided by Total Approach Volume 

Percent of Vehicles Stopped = Number Stopped ( Unique ) divided by Approach Volume
